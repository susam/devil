;;; Commentary:

;; Devil intercepts your devil key (comma by default) to let you type
;; key sequences without using modifier keys.  Devil is highly

buffers which have not called the hooks where a minor-mode could
be applied, the decision to bypass these hooks is likely to have
been intentional.  It is not recommended to enable this option

To work around the most common issue, where `global-devil-mode'
